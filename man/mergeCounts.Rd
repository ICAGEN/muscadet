\title{Merge counts for \code{muscadet} objects}
\usage{
mergeCounts(x, reference, nor.het = TRUE, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\link[=muscadet-class]{muscadet}} object containing sample data
(\code{muscadet}). This object must include clustering assignments in the
\code{cnacalling$clusters} slot.}

\item{reference}{A \code{\link[=muscadet-class]{muscadet}} object containing reference
data (\code{muscadet}).}

\item{nor.het}{A logical value to specify if normal reference allele counts
are modified to: total normal depth counts divided by 2, to force these
positions to be heterozygous in the normal reference in allelic data (e.g.
when heterozygous positions are retrieve based on matched bulk sequencing
data, and are thereby assumed to be heterozygous) before combining coverage
and allelic data. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, suppresses informative messages during
execution. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A modified \code{\link[=muscadet-class]{muscadet}} object corresponding to the \code{x}
\code{\link[=muscadet-class]{muscadet}} object, with updated \code{cnacalling} slot containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{allelic.counts}: Processed allelic counts on variant positions, for all omics.
\item \code{coverage.counts}: Processed coverage counts merged with the reference.
\item \code{combined.counts}: Combined data for allelic and coverage counts.
}
Abbreviations:
\itemize{
\item RD = Reference allele read depth
\item AD = Alternative allele read depth
\item DP = Total read depth
\item TUM = tumor sample
\item NOR = normal reference
\item omic = omic specific (\code{omic} column)
\item all = for all omics
}
}
\description{
This function combines allelic (counts at variant positions, either common
SNPs or individual-specific heterozygous positions) and coverage counts
(counts on features) from all omics per cluster for both sample and
reference. The resulting merged data is stored in the \code{cnacalling} slot of
the sample \code{\link[=muscadet-class]{muscadet}} object.
}
\examples{
# Load example muscadet object
# data("muscadet_obj")
# data("muscadet_obj_ref")

# Merge counts from all omics from both sample and reference
muscadet_obj <- mergeCounts(muscadet_obj, muscadet_obj_ref)

}
